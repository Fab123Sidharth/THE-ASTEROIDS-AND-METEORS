    Asteroids are the large rocky stones which lie in Asteroid Belt ,in between of "Mars" and "Jupiter".
    <br>
    <br>
    Asteroids range in size from <b> Ceres </b> – the largest at about 1003 kilometers in diameter – to bodies that are less than 33 feet (10 meters) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth's Moon.

<p class="p2">
    Meteors are small objects made up mainly of stones present in space. They regularly enter the Earth's atmosphere. As a Meteor enters the Earth's atmosphere at a high speed , it is heated by friction with air, and in most cases it burns to ashes in a very short time. As it heats up and burns, it apppears as a glowing streak of light and is called a shooting star.
    <br>
    <br>
    If a meteor is large, it may fall on the Earth's surface before being completely burnt out. Such meteors are called <b>meteorites</b>.
